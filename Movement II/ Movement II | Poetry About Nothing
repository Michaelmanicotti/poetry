Movement II | Poetry about nothing.

It is interesting. I chose the name of this movement 
before I found out why I would need to write this particular type of poetry.

  "For those called to art who do struggle with an overwhelming sensativity,
  the creative process can have a theraputic power. 
  It offers a sense of deep connection.
  A safe place to voice the unspeakable and bare their soul.
  In these cases, art does not unravel the maker, but makes them whole."
