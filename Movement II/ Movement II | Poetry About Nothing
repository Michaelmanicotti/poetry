Movement II | Poetry about nothing.

It is interesting. I chose the name of this movement 
before I found out why I would need to write this particular type of poetry.

"It is never lonesome in babylon...
It is in the interludes between being in company that we talk to ourselves.
In the silence we listen to ourselves.
Then we ask questions to ourselves,
and in the quietude we may even hear the voice of god."

              Maya Angelou
              "Even the Stars Look Lonesome Sometimes"
              1998
