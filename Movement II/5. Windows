I am unsure
if I have finished my recovery.

I am waiting
for the line that indicates the end of withdrawl
and the begining of so-called regular life.
It does not seem to be labeled very well.

I find myself exhausted by people
I easily spiral when alone
It is merely a matter of "overthinking"
A word we like to throw around
Like and insult
To those who need care
and compassion
and love.
But instead we forefit those rights
"by chosing" to venture into the realm of overthinking.

I would love for others to do some of my thinking for me
To pass off my emotions in the form of conversation
To end my constant insuffereable monolouge 
with anechdotes of some minor passion of others that make life so worth living

I want to have control of when I am lonely and when I have the help of others
At least enough to catch up on sleep
Remind me to eat food
to feel like myself again.

Instead I get windows
glances of moments that feel right
problems whose solutions feel in my wheel house
interactions that leave me less to think about
feeling unaccused and unjudged
these times help me begin to take stock
to make sense of what is life and what is recovery
to note that the former has an ever increasing inventory.
