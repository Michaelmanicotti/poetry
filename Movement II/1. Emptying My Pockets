Emptying My Pockets

Sometimes I know why I'm sad
Sometimes, I have to check my pockets.

The whole world makes me sad
It's hard to see the strings that connect us
In our culture, we're not supposed to look at them
We're not supposed to agknoledge them
We're not taught to value them.

Most of all,
It's hard to know that the strings connect back to you
It makes you a part of all of the problems and all of the suffering
It means the whole world makes you sad.

I am trying to take care of myself better
We are taught this means putting blinders on
We are taught this means we must stop focusing on the strings
Worst of all, we are taught to cut them
When we are feeling sad
Or possibly empty
Or else a lack of support.

I'm no good at this
No good at blinders
No good with scizors
No good at convincing myself I'm not a part of the problem.
No good at pretending the worlds problems aren't a part of me.

Instead,
I just put things in my pockets
Hide away the big and the complex
So I can be polite
So I can be with company

Today, 
My pockets are a collection of knick knacks that remind me of the big problems
That remind me I am connected to it all
All the things I hate
All the suffering that sticks with me

I am trying to step back and take care of myself
I am... less present for the world
I more and more use hiding away and trying to figure it all out
I don't seem to matter in the face of it all.
Yet there is no guilt amoungst it.
I do not feel guilty.
Nor can I anymore construct a convincing argument to change my approach.

Instead,
I just sit here 
and go through my pockets:
