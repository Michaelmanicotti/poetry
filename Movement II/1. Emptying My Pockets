Emptying My Pockets

Sometimes I know why I'm sad
Sometimes, I have to check my pockets.

The whole world makes me sad
It's hard to see the strings that connect us
In our culture, we're not supposed to look at them
We're not supposed to agknoledge them
We're not taught to value them.

Most of all,
It's hard to know that the strings connect back to you
It makes you a part of all of the problems and all of the suffering
It means the whole world makes you sad.

I am trying to take care of myself better
We are taught this means putting blinders on
We are taught this means we must stop focusing on the strings
Worst of all, we are taught to cut them
When we are feeling sad
Or possibly empty
Or else a lack of support.

I'm no good at this
No good at blinders
No good with scizors
No good at convincing myself I'm not a part of the problem.
No good at pretending the worlds problems aren't a part of me.

Instead,
I just put things in my pockets
Hide away the big and the complex
So I can be polite
So I can be with company

Today, 
My pockets are a collection of knick knacks that remind me of the big problems
That remind me I am connected to it all
All the things I hate
All the suffering that sticks with me

I am trying to step back and take care of myself
I am... less present for the world
I more and more use hiding away and trying to figure it all out
I don't seem to matter in the face of it all.
Yet there is no guilt amoungst it.
I do not feel guilty.
Nor can I anymore construct a convincing argument to change my approach.

Instead,
I just sit here 
and go through my pockets:

A matchbook from the pretty boy I hooked up with,
He's not just beautiful but suprisingly witty,
He seems to like me.
He is an exceptional poet.
He works a lot, he focuses on paying the bills.
He is smart enough for a degree but stopped at a diploma.
He was fun at the club and more fun after,
the matches were from the next morning.
He forgot his lighter,
I left him the matches because he seemed worried and itchy at the idea of not being high before work started.
He has a beautiful soul. Honest and kind. 
And he shudders at the idea of facing the world sober.
Even just for one morning.
I am 21, he is 22.
He reminds me of the others.
I have seen it all before.
Eventually, I will chose not to get invested.

A grocery list for my brother
Who realized he wanted to be better at showing up for me
at the same time I realized I wanted to be better on my own.
He is so good at taking care of me.
And he always has been.
And sometime I get so angry at him.
He's getting better at expressing himself.
I want to tell him he's doing a good job,
I want to tell him that I just was at a spot with my mental health
and I'm trying to be better.
Instead I am sad for no reason.
The grocery list was so we could make chili,
it is one part learning
two parts crafting a delishous meal
and three parts an exuse to spend time together
a symbol for getting better at the little things.
I don't have the heart to tell him I don't want to cook
or the courage to get out of bed and face it.
I just want to curl up and exist.
And I am so tired,
sad and tired.
And I have a grocery list even though I will not be going grocery shoping,
it reminds me that the people who you love the most are the ones you will most often let down,
your grief will spill over to them.
Even if it doesn't make sense to them,
or they don't know what to do.
I am content with my decision to stay in,
but I still hold the momento in my pocket.

I have a straw wrapper from brunch.
Where my sister informed us she would be spitting up from her partner
Slipped in between bites of cinnamon bun french toast was the end of a five year relationship,
"An affordable apartment for just her and the baby,"
Then after discussing her drink order with the waiter added
"it's been a long time coming."
None of us knew this,
or maybe it was only me who didn't know.
I was more suprised at the turn of events than her decision not to tell me,
of all the family members I have failed to show up for her the most.
And I'm not doing anything to change that.
And I just want to be 22, and I just want to spend the year trying to be myself
and I'm not guilty.
And I also hold on to the straw wrapper in my pocket.

And there are others,
the girl I have been most unknind to in all my struggles,
I did not budget the weekend to make space for reconnecting,
and I am too tired to add things to the budget.
There is the boy who needs a place to stay while he's looking from an apartment
who I need to text to inform that my place will no longer be avalible.


And my dad,
who I forgot, can't lift his grandchild right noe
until he leaned over to reveal the stiches across his sternum,
from the heart surgery I wasn't there for.
It's been two weeks since then.
This is the first time I've seen him since
and he drove to me.
I just keep this knowledge in my pocket as a knick-knick.

It is not that I don't want to exist.
It is only that I want to exist without the responsibilty
of being connected to the rest of the world.
At least untill I feel like myself again.

For now I just want to be empty.
For now I just want to be tire.
For now I just want to be safe.
