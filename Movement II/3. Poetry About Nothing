Ther is so much to do
So much to take in.

I must sit
curled up
on the couch
by the window

I must listen to the wind
and the birds
and the light

I must share the space
with my brother
withe my family
and know that every moment I'm with him 
I am safe

There is air that must be breathed
A heart rate that must beat on
There are arms to be kept chilly
And a blanket to cover my feet.

It's all so busy
all so overwhelming
I don't know how much more I can take

The quiet
And the softness
And the beauty.

The cat in the window 
spontaneously appears

It's hard to know what's going on inside her head
While she looks around
I sit and write
Some poetry about nothing.
