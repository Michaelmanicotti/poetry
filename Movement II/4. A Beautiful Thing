Right now,
The whole world is a house of cards.
Every point of contact is liable to collapse into instability
The whole sysem, is at it's critical point
The waves are incalcuble
The impact potential could race away into the highly connected network
Or else fade into nothingness
There is no way of knowing

Right now,
I tip toe
I creep
I smile

I do not stomp
or run
or dare to breath

Each step must be minimized
Each moment made invisible- no
infintisimal?
inconsequential.

Right now,
The preference is twoards minimizing my existance
For now,
it is a beautiful thing.
