We have not always been good at loving each other
But we have always strived to understand each other
And in doing so
We became better able to understand ourselves

There was conflict
There was truama
There was rainy days and bitter nights

But we both kept showing up
We both kept trying to figure it out
We both wanted to face the world
And love kept showing up

I never knew what to do with it
I never knew how to react
my impulse wants to sound the alarm
but love is a quiet act

It's never been loud
But it's always been there
I'm not sure what it will look like
I'm not sure what to do

Maybe I'm imagining it
Maybe you are too
