Love is loneliness
It is the feeling of being by yourself with no one around

Loneliness is lovelessness
The feeling of lacking the necessary to support
The ability to be expressive

Love is reflection
it is cold analysis and unflinching facing the truth
It is a willingness to step out of the beloved cocoon

Love is silent
and loud
and soft and squishy

Love is
-first and foremost-
inconspicuous
it hides away in the threads of the fabric of your life
holding everything together

Love is compelling
If you can ever learn to listen to it or trust it.

Love is there.
The question is: where are you?

To be somewhere is to be loved.
To be nowhere is to be nobody.
