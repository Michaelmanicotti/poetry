I would love to measure my life in notebooks.
If only I can keep writing stuff down
There's just too much to do
And too much going on
And it's so hard to put the pen to the page
to make myself sit still for long enough to get it all out

I would love to measure my life in moments
In the time I thought things through
I want to have taken the deep breaths I needed
I want to know I showed up when I needed to

I want people to think of me as thoughtful
I want people to know I'm kind
I want to be good at love
I want to look back
Through all the things people thought
And know I can look back with pride

I want to measure my life in grace
I want it to be off the charts
I want to forgive myself more
and others
And to know I gave it my all

I would love to measure my life in notebooks
I want to die knowing I showed up
I want an abundance of the things that are always so hard
And I'm worried I might fuck it all up. â™¡
