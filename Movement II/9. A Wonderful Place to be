Our friendship is written in a delicate language
in space
both created and closed

In silence when others would have had to speak
In words spoken even when we couldn’t find the right ones

In smiles and greetings, some that take effort, some that do not
In exasperated huffs and tense moments
In understanding
In confusion
In truth and in lies.

In secrets
In fear
In personal growth
In pained expressions
In sympathetic respect
In assumptions we have to talk about later
In hints we missed or ignored

In delightful surprise made without effort
In hard sacrifices that required no thoughts

In learning
In copying
In mirroring

In a single tiny beat of silence



where we are trying to figure out if we’re on the same page
In the long pauses where we try and get our thoughts together
Where we hope we can be good enough.

It has been rocked by the world
and wrinkled by the moments

Together we have held our breath
and watched our step

Together we have danced
without thought
without question
without rules
and without looking where we’re going

We have crafted a normal that makes sense to us.
The wonderful place.
