We want it to be true
that loving us is easy
that being our friend is simply fun

we want the good times to spill over
into everyone elses lives

we want to rewrite the contract
we want to tell ourselves lies
we want attachment not to hurt so much
we want it to be easy when we die

except the people around us are stubborn
out of love
and out of grit
when the storms come rolling in
we watch as they get hit

we want love to be different
we want it to end it's affair with grief

we want our family to love us
but we hate what it actually means

it a brutal thing to watch
our pain pull apart the laughter

and more beautiful to see
that they're still with us after
