It is hard to tell
in the moment
wether we jumped
or we got pushed

when you are falling into chaos
when you are staring into the abyss
you can't remember if you wanted to get off the cliff
because you didn't want to be on land anymore
or if it is because someone was chasing you

they never told you to jump
but they knew what they wanted
and you knew what they were trying to say
and so you jumped

you didn't know what was waiting for you at the bottom
you didn't know how long you would be falling through the fog
you didn't know what landing would do to you
or who you'd be when you got there
but knew knew you needed to jump
so you did

the truth is
it could have been the wind,
"had it been on your face
instead of at your back
you might not have done it"
you realize as you're falling

but when you splash down
when you hit the water
you realize
you were born to swim
