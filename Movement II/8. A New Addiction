I'm trying to get addicted to silence
I'm actively looking for the quiet
That mythical place
Where I can here god's voice

It is not in my nature
To sit still
To listen close
To let life pass me by
To not know what I'm listening for.

I don't follow the currents
I impulsively resist them
I push and I prode
and I fight my way up stream

I'm addicted to going overboard
to pumping music in my ears
my body likes moving
my thoughts often tell me
"pick everything up and run"

I'm looking for the silence
and I find myself overwhelmed
for you have to give up
and lose control
if you want to hear

I don't want to be a hero
I don't want to be a villian
I don't want to be a failure
I just want to be here

Here is where the world doesn't need you.
Here is where you can be present regardless
Here is where you know the world spins and there are things to do
But you are just here

I'm winding myself down
The process is unbearably slow
The silence doesn't swamp you
It ebs and it flows
It is a cautious careful tide
That doesn't want to hurt the shore
It is an ocean that stops
As soon as you get nervous
It floats away like a butterfly
totally unchasable
you just have to sit and listen
you just have to lay back and float
you have to trust the tide will move you
and while youre away, nothing will break

I'm trying to get addicted to peace
to be present when I'm there
to carefully collect my energy
and finally be somewhere

I'm trying to step back
from the collective consouness
to drift amoungst the quietude
and stare into the abyss
