I'm trying to get addicted to silence
I'm actively looking for the quiet
That mythical place
Where I can here god's voice

It is not in my nature
To sit still
To listen close
To let life pass me by
To not know what I'm listening for.

I don't follow the currents
I impulsively resist them
I push and I prode
and I fight my way up stream

I'm addicted to going overboard
to pumping music in my ears
my body likes moving
my thoughts often tell me
"pick everything up and run"

I'm looking for the silence
and I find myself overwhelmed
for you have to give up
and lose control
if you want to hear

I don't want to be a hero
I don't want to be a villian
I don't want to be a failure
I just want to be here
