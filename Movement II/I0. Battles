I am always at war with myself
And it always all seeps out

I wish I could draw the battle lines
Such that it ends outside my mind
To create a zone of peace
So that others will be fine

But there is always a stray missel
a stray bullet, there's been a few
So my battles take out others
And still, the battles begin aknew.

I wish that I could simply
Push the casualties down to one
But the more I live, the more I realize
Others know when the battles are done

They batten down the hatches
they switch out their sails
they are also going to battle
and they don't want me to fail

I have to draw them in
so that the battles can be won
I just pray they'll be left in tact
whenever the battle is done.

The stuborn thing is stuborness
I keep pushing the battle line back
But I hope I can find a plataue
If not for me, than for those who have my back
