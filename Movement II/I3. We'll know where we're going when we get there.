And there is only okay
and there is only okay for now
and there is only being honest
with yourself
about what exactly that means
and there is only being honest
with yourself
that you don't know yet

And there is no progress
and there is no story
and there is no grand plan
there is only now
and only okay
and not okay
and that is enough

We do not chose wether we are out at sea
we do not get to ask that the waves stop
we let ourself get rocked
and we do what we can to stay afloat

do what we can to be okay
and hope the boats okay
and if not
we swim

we take one stroke at a time
one breath at a time
one piece of floating rubble to hold on to
and we don't know
and we can't know
and we can't make
we can only have okay for now
and not okay

At some point we see land
at somepoint we get pulled ashore
and it's sometimes sooner than we expect
and it's sometimes leter than we need it to be
and we hope
and we pray
that it's not too late.

But we don't have a choice
where the current takes us
when the wind is at our sails
when the water will be smooth
we only have the vessel
and we only have the sea

and we only have okay
we have okay for now
and we'll know where we're going
when we get there
