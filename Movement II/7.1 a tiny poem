This is my home
These are my walls
here I am alone
here I am not alone
here everything is just love.

My job is to be here.
My job is to be me.
My job is to let it all out.
My job is to hold it all in.
My job is to breath
and cope
and be
and write
and work
and eat 
and sleep.

But most of all just to be here,
because this is where I live.
