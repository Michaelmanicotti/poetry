Just because something is responsive doesn't mean you need someone to respond.
Sometimes you just need to be.

We all err on a side,
that doesn't make us flawed.
It makes us useful and beautiful.
We just have to figure out what that means.

Sometimes evolution means doing too much
sometimes it means doing nothing.
Whatever the case, best to let it all keep going
and changing.
