Hopefully when we meet again, it will be under different circumstances

My loyal reader,

For the record, this is not what I wanted my first book to be. I had hoped my first book would be evocative and insightful non-fiction or nuanced and authoritative fiction.

As I wrote, a book began to take form. The poems organized themselves into "movements" and the movements ebbed and flowed until I had the feeling I had finished something. Something I wanted to share, I hope this helps. (And lord do I pray that this project doesn't get me labeled as some kind of poet.)

Looking back at it, I think of the great James Baldwin who once said that his early work was the things he needed to unpack so he could go on and write other things. That's what this book is for me. I offer you no explanation, only a promise: my next book, should I write one, will be very different and hopefully so will all the ones after that.
