If I am going to suffer
I suffer not for power

If I am going to understand
I must do it not for gain

because power
power is the cruelest and most sadistic of teachers
and it cares not what you can do

to learn from it is to teach it
to suffer for it, is to show it it's full capacity

the generation above me taught us
that power is worth everything else
and now they sit
bewildered
at all of the suffering they have wrought

there is a time for war
but it is not with us any longer
and we have been taught to lie
about what war can and cannot be

If I must see power
I will suffer in resistance
I will teach it nothing and offer it nothing
and expect nothing in return

We are the generation
that has been forced to heal
and so we must struggle with healing
and we must struggle with repair
and we must struggle to return
all that you stole
we refuse what you try and teach us
and we take what you did not offer yourselves

And we will fail to fix much
but we will astonish you 
with your incompetence
you will not see the grace of history
and by sheer juxtaposition to your own shildren
you will be remembered 
not for your struggles or your triumphs
but for all that you fail to achieve
and they will ask themselves
"what took so long?"

and this is good.

For if we must struggle
we do it in the persuit of friendship
and community
and reparations
we will struggle to define justice in living truth
because we understand the connection
between love and liberation

and you chose not to

And to all those who watched
and to all those who participated
as the cyle of war and peace
turned to the struggle between liberation and oppression
I hope you meet god in the afterlife
because you did not know him while you were here
