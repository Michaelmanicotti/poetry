My box
is in another box
in the other room
for now.

It is trying to make me anxious
It is trying to make me think about communicating with people
That I don't need to be communicating with
Thinking about people
I don't need to be thinking about it.

And in exchange
for all this anxiety
It offers me endless solace.
It offers me a way to ignore and increase the passage of time.
It offers me information
exciting information, enticing information
useless information...

Addiction, believe it or not
Feels a lot like the illusion of learning

Learning, like love
Feels quite bad, quite often

The box offers me neither.

Some days
Our relationship is quite healthy
I go about my business
It goes about it's business

Somedays,
it forgets it's place.
It's maker does not serve me.
Nor do they serve the people.
It is a thing
made by systems
made by ideology
made by creatures
made by god
Which makes it four times removed.

This does not make it unlike god necessarily
It does mean that those particular creatures
with that particular ideology
under those particular systems
Have gotten uniquely good at robbing me of my autonomy.
Making me shake with anxiety.
And convincing me that it
more so than my friends
family
and hard work
are capable of bringing me contentment.

It is a dangerous box.
And I am an equally dangerous person
it all works out
as long as I make sure to put it in its place.
And use it only in its dues time.

Reality is a social construct
which means
we all must become better engineers.
