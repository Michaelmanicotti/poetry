We wanted to know how far we could reach
Wanted to scope out how far we could see
Wanted to know what we might fin
If only we kept zooming out
and building up
and climbing higher

The data got bigger
The tower got taller
the trends got more frightening
the world became more opressive,
more violent, more monotonous
we zoomed so far we forgot who we were
we got lost in our lives
we sall the world as so small
we began to think we were isolated the whole time.

What we don't know is that the seeing
is what changed us
The myoptia became deliberate
we got lost
and we forgot how to live.
