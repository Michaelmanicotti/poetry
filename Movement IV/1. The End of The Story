It is not just
that change scares me
consistency scares me
inevitability scares me

even worse
beyond the fear
there is anger
undying anger
the wish
unrelenting
indomitable
that I can make the world bend to my will

it is protective
I am angry at the state of things
I am angry at our cultures skill
for generating undo suffering

and so I fear complacency
in the face of consistency
in the face of dynamic cruelty
under the collective illusion of comfort

in other words, I fear those who fear change
and I hate them
for not bringing it about

I am sorry
and I love you
and the thing about love is
it is very hard to cope with

and for me
it takes time
a long time
to figure out what loving someone is supposed to look like

to figure out who I am
within the context of love
and moreover to separate
who love is trying to make me
from the person I imagine I want to be

And in this case
as in all others
I know I can do better
and that is a beautiful gift

and it is one I sometimes find
only after trying every other arrangement
and I don't know why it happens this way
but this is the process

I fear it makes me cruel.
I fear I will never better cope.

I fear the irreversibility of the damage
I might wrought on the world
And I fear
the inability to heal from the damage
it has wrought on me

And infrequently it occurs to me
that outside myself there is healing
and deep within my heart there is a capacity for kindness
that others know better than I do

And at its essence
that is love.
It is space, capacity, healing, growth
It is pushing yourself out when you get stuck
sometimes by any means necessary
And it is anchoring yourself
desperately trying to find something to hang on to
in the barrage of constant movement

And so it is not change
nor consistency
but instead
a deep horrific fear
that I am out of step
with who the world needs me to be.
