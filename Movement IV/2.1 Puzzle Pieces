"For some reason, you decided words are too cheap
expression meaningless
If you know how you feel
Why say it
Why waste your breath?
Why not simply weave your feelings into the intangible?
Why not sprinkle it in?
With greetings and gestures and moments and movements...
You are right to think this stuff matters
You are right to mind the details
When things are going well this is more than enough

At times I am deafend 
By the words you never bothered to find
I sit with all your actions as puzzle pieces
spread out upon the floor
Praying they'll make a picture I'll like
Crashing when I find a piece that doesn't fit
I don't even know what picture I'm trying to make
Because you're the one who drew it in the first place
So I'm solving puzzles
when you should be looking for the words"

I have a special hate in my heart
for all those who say words don't matter

and I hate 
most of all the hopelessness
and secondly the laziness
they have decided this out of convienence
because the truth is 
words matter so much
that sometimes saying the right words 
is the hardest thing we can do

words
it turns out
must be searched for
they must be hunted down
words like I'm sorry
I forgive you
I can't do this anymore
I still love you
I need space
I need time
I can finally trust you again
these words
are treasure to be brought back
after a long and harrowing journey
we all know what they mean when they are empty
because we all know what it takes for them to be meaningful

these words sit between 
never feeling like they're enough
and not always being there yet
it can take hard word
it can take mistakes and ommisions
it can take lifetimes to get there
and sometimes we never get there
but we only know when we've left where we are
and we can't know unless we've left a record

And the worst thing we can do
sometimes the most violent thing we can do
is to say nothing
  nothing is okay
  when there's nothing to be said
but to let the moments pass
To give up on the epic
To say: nothing
Is to forefit the task of participating in your life
And the lives of those around you

After the anger fades
the dispair wavers
the war ends
the ceasefire is called
that is when we most desperatly need words

And I hate
those who leave us in silence
because they leave us to face the world
all by ourselves
