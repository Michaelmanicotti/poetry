They are back
And they bring with them a sense of hopeless
They are quite striking
evokative
frightening, even

they do not shout
they stare
they stare in a way that shouts
"do something"

they are born of hopelessness
they are born because their creator 
did not know what to do
but knew
they needed to do something

they are something
not much
not the right thing
not impactful
simply evokative

they hold with them
the anger at complecancy
the terror of the powerless
the verbosity of the sophic

they hold in them
the emptiness of an empty gesture
the anxiety 
of that moment
when a false smile
fades to honest dispair

they are meant to evoke change
to invoke movement
to incite action
but

we look away
we can't, we don't, we won't.
they are dishonest and guarded and unnecisarily confrontational
they tell us not what we can do
they only want us to do something
and so we look away
we don't want the false hope of their creators
we don't want to do
simply because something needs to be done
we want to do because

we don't want to spend our days making more of them
when we don't know what to do with ourselves
