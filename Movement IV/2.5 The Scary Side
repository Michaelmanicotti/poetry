I posses
within me
the rage of the gods
"an irish temper"

what many peoples reveard
but today remains obsolete, vestigial
it is something that must be maintained
not by me
but by my family
by my community
through careful practice
and honesty
and kindness

and forgiveness

they have lifted me
dragged me
through all the seasons
and all the tides

I am afraid
I am afraid of who I am when I am him
I am afraid of when and how he might be triggered
I am afraid of the damage he'll do to my life
I am afraid that I will need him
That he is a part of me
That he has guided me to where I am
That he wants me to move to a place of power

Fear and anger
it is worth noting
create the appearence of negation
and wrought internal turmoil

they must be dealt with swiftly
and seperatly
with precision

and if not, delicately turned
clockwise
upwards through vigilance and twoard joy
downward through wonder and grief
or outward through detechment

they cannot be used in tandum
they cannot be hardbored willingly
they cannot be mixed
with romance
or with guilt
and most of all
they cannot be allowed to manifest
as contempt
for yourself or for others

for this will bring the end of worlds

I live a fractured life
and across these fractures
lays the ability to warp the social fabric.
During peacetime this is a blessing
But I fea what my body percieves as war
Because I know it is me who will go to battle.
