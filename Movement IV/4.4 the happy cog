When I was a kid
I suberted that dreadful question
with "the renesance man"
I wanted to be good at eveything

Now that I'm older
I truely believe I only have one skill
One that has gotten me everything else
Admiration

Through this I have built myself a life:
The people I have found
The author's I read
The friends
The chosen family
They are, who I am
They are my accomplishments
they hold the weight of my burden
such that I am free

In my country
there is a shared, kafkaesque nightmare
"a cog in a machine"
we do not fear being a cog
we fear the machine we are a part of
