Kieren,

It's kind of funny that you said that you're angry at the world all the time.
Because in the process of getting to know you, there is a small part of me that is angry at the world all the time too.

Usually when I'm angry at the world I can funnel it into something: fixing a problem, writing stories, reading books.
Finding a problem and addressing the problem.
This is not that.

It's just anger. And it won't go away and there's nothing to do about it. It's just anger and it's there and it's there all the time.

I have a theory.

You're not supposed to exist. And if all my experience with the world has lead me to believe you're not supposed to exist, 
I can't can't imagine what your experience with the world must be like.

You should figure that out though. Being angry all the time isn't really my thing and it's been inconviencing me.

It's funny though, at somepoint I told you you're at your most impressive when you're angry. And that's true, even when you're angry at me.

It's quite earth shaking actually.

I am however, very happy you exist. And happy isn't the right word for it.

P.S. If you're reading this, you should write more. Now that I've finished my first memior, I'd kill to see yours.
Your story is worth telling, what ever that means.
