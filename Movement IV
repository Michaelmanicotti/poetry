    "It is neverlonesome in babylon. 
     Of course, one needs to examine who he has for company.

     Many believe rgat they need company at any cost, 
     And certainly, if a thing is desired at any cost, 
     it will be obtained at all costs.

     We need to remember and to teach our children
     that solitude can be a much-to-be-desired condition.
     Not only is it acceptable  to be alone,
     but sometime's it is posatively to be wished for.

     It is in the interludes between being in company that we talk to ourselves.
     In the silence we listen to ourselves.
     Then we ask questions of ourselves.
     We describe ourselves to ourselves,
     and in the quietitude, we may even hear the voice of God."
         
          -Maya Angelou

That book is one of Maya Angelous last works. I read it because it has the worlds most rediculous detication.
It was deticated to me and my generation and attached to it was the following assignment:
"eliminate warfare, promote equality, exile disease and increase joy. In fact, to make this a perfect world."
I have a lot of respect for Maya Angelou and I knew that first and foremost that she is not a woman who isn't
to be careful with her words. I wanted to know what in gods name she could write in the 143 pages to follow
that would help us to accomplish such a loftly task. It did not disapoint.

I don't know about a perfect world, but we'll work on it.
