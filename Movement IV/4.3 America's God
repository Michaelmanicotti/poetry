Americans do not understand God
and we are obssesed with power
so we've decided we don't need him

we want god
to be all good
and all knowing
because we want to be all good 
and all knowing
we have forgotten

humans are not good
humans are
humans do not know
or not know

we operate
as humans
we exist
beyond reason
beyond explination

in fact
this is what god is
god is knowledge beyond explination
and to worship god
is to worship the unknowing
and the inexplicable

and so we hate him
because he is not something to be understood

and to fear god
is to know the unknowable will never be achieved
we do not fear his power
for god has no relationship to power
we think of him as pwerful
because we want him to be

in truth,
god begins, by definition
where our power ends
where trust begins

and so we hate him
because we fear him
because it is always fear that tells us where our power ends
and where trust begins

The word 
the text
the exercise
this is an aproximation
and to know god
is to know we are aproximating

and have been
for a long time
this does not mean we will not get set adrift
even as an entire people
indeed, definitionally we will
but this does not mean the endeavor is not worth our time

In America
We chose that god and science 
are in opposition
when science is
and always has been
spiritual practice
religous practice
and frequently
regrettably evangalistic and disconnected from the natural world

and yet
we engage in the practice
we search for truth and it's limits
and we hope to teach our young to do the same

And like every church before us
at our worst
we pretend we are disconnected from the thing we study
we pretend god is a noun
truth is a noun
power is a noun
when it is in fact a verb
and always has been

so we collect our truths
the way those who came before us collected their scripture
and then we live our life
some in the practice of worship
some not
and together we abandon
the beauty of the knowable and indescribable

And we build a society
that contradicts our science
our shared definition of truth
just as we critize our ancestors

And the difference is
our access to truth
to religeous practice
to be and live as close to god as we can approximate
is far greater than our ancestors was.

We have the capacity
what we need is dicipline, tradition and practice.
