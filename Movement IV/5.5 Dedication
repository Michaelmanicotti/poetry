they do not wait for others to give them freedom
they do not sit and wait for it to come

they create it
actively
and with every brush stroke and every breath
they do not ask for permision
because they understand it is their deivine right

and no matter how they are constrined
they will fill in the gaps
and they will push the boundaries

they will offer you no explination
they will wait
for you to ask them their ways

and they will decide
exactly how much room their freedom has for you
and that is how I want to be judged
and that is how I would like to go forth

and there is no way to study this art
you write when you need to, you feel when you need to, you express when you need to, you find community when you need to, you give back when you need to
and you find a way to pay it forward
whenever you can

and in this way 
we are uplifted

many poems have been written on this 
and we will still need many more
