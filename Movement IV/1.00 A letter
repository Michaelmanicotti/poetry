To whomever it may concern,

I apologize for the upcoming movement, things are about get quite lengthy.

In truth, I am scared. I don't think I am ready for argument in long form.

I need more time.

I want poems that are technical and argumentative and angry/

I want permision to show up to this practice with all my masculinity.

This movement is niether delicate nor precise,
this is where shit starts to get real.

Always in love, always yours

Michael D. Mann
