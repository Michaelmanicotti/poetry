It's written in wingdings because it's a secret. 

When I was drugged
and sexually assaulted 
It was uncommon
for me to fear it would happen to me again.

Indeed,
I knew I was better prepared
for the rest of my life
having gone through it all

Instead,
near constantly
I was afraid
That there was no difference between me and the perptrator

I still believe that to be true
To be that close
To that kind of violence
In all it's modernity
Is to learn what you are capable of.

And for all of us
who have power
what we fear
desperatly

is how unaware we are
of how we're using it.
