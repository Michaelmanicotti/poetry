We are the ones who have enough
and we get angry
and we are scared
and we don't know how we will make it through the day

and we have course ourselves with enough
with seeing enough
because we know we have it
and we know others don't

and we have cursed ourselves with vision
that sees enough and not enough
but cannot destiguish between enough and plentiful
and cannot destiguidh between plentiful and full
and we cannot see the conductor
but we know who makes the music
and we know who sits in the audience

and we lie to ourselves
and we believe the music is ours
and we believe the people who made it to be happy
and we believe that it is not possible to build a stage
unless it is also a cage

And we sit in the audience and clap
and we go out to dinner and we laugh
and when we get home
we're not sure if we've made it
(and we tell ourselves we have.)

We believe it all works because we have enough
we believe that enough is something we cannot give
because if we ever think about giving enough
we know we might lose it

And so
we hoard enough
we market enough
we sell enough
we convince enough
we work enough
we sleep enough
we lie enough
and we don't know how to do otherwise

because if we are the ones who have enough
what do we have left?

we have only the question
the question that racks us all
until our dying days
the one question we must never dare to ask
and never let each other try to answer
because if we do
all the eough,
all the enough we barely have,
all the enough we don't know how we got
it might not be enough anymore
and so we repeat it, religously
that we have enough,
everyone
each of us
we all have just enough
that it is not even possible to have more than enough

because as long as we have enough
we never have to wonder
if there's enough to go around
