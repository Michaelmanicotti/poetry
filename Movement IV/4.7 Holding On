There are somethings
that every generation must learn on their own
that are the same lesson everytime
and yet everytime they are different

And sometimes a lesson we think has been around forever
something that can never change
sometimes it gets forgotten
and one day it will be learned again

it is not our job to collectively decide
it is our job to participate responsibly
and this thing
is just a thing humans to
it is older than humans are
and it will go on with out us

the best thing we can do
is try not to hold on
