What is happening right now
Is the begining of history.
It is the begining of agriculture
it is the begining of culture
and art
and cities
and buildings
and disasters
and subjugation
and civilzation

It is hard to tell
because it's only ever happened once before
we aren't even sure what our descendants will call it 
this time
but we know they will not live lives like ours
And to them we will be strange.

and they will look back
and they will find a video
of a little kid streching their legs
and jumping
so that way they might fit their foot prints
into the footprints of those who walked before them
and they will think to themselves
"humans never really change"

and their world will be fundamentally different
and we niether know then nor now
and they will know both
but for now
what a time it is...
