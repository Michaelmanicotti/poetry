Growing up is strange
In a way everything is the same
There are still ups
Still downs
Still life threatening responses to things that are fine
Still things that aren't fine
  but we don't have the words to explain how right now

But there is this otherness
this command that kicks in
It's still a difficult sjip to fly
But at least the ship seems familiar
At least it's yours

It's strange to realize
there's nothing left
there's not secret, no code, no hidden knowledge
just people, left to their own decisions
doing people things
only now you're one of them
and you seem to spend all your time doing people things too

It is more scary
Knowing yourself definitionally makes it harder to change

But that's why we have love,
that's why we have generational wisdom,
and that's why we have today's youth
and god knows, they just keep getting younger

My generation
we inherited a lot
and we've got a lot of work to do.
If god is willine,
we will do our part.
