We don't get to ask for the land
We don't get to ask for the sea
The thing we can do, if we're corageous
is ask for time with just you and me

We don't get to ask for a lifetime
We don't know what happens over the years
The most we can do, is just find a way
To be alive for the time that we're here

We don't get to ask to be happy
We can't waste our time avoiding pain
But for now, we're here and we're trying
And tomorrow we'll pray for the same

We're not really sure when it's coming
And we can spend our days sitting and waiting
or we can go out and travel around
And be glad for now that we're aging
