I've got a lot of coping mechanisms
art, exercise, food, doctors
sometimes it feels like I need more than everyone else

I listen
to those who say
"writing through my feelings, it's not for me"
"those type's of books, they're just not for me"
"talk therapy, it's not for me"
"medication..."
"working out..."
"meditation..."
"honestly confronting others about my emotions..."
and sometimes I agree with them
(there are thing's on that list that are indeed 
not for me.)
But I sit 
and I wonder
Because even though I have my preffered methods
There's nothing I wouldn't try

Sometime's I feel like my whole life
is part of a delicately balanced mental health regime
and it is so easy
for so much to go wrong
for me to get stuck
that I don't think I can afford to turn down
healthy coping mechanisms
not anymore

I have this fear,
the one coping mechanism I fear above all else
I worry the world will harden me
And if not, in the process of protecting 
all my soft parts
all my beautiful parts
I will force myself to go totally numb

I know
if that happens
I won't know that it's happening
and I will lie
I will say nothing has changed
"I'm still the same person I was
when I was soft and squishy
and I wrote all that poetry."
I've seen it happen

nothing has made the world more scary
than what others have decided the world already is

And so I cope
I eat, I sleep, I exercise
I write, I read, I study
I laugh, I cry, I get angry
I go out, I stay in
I talk, I listen
I remeber
Just how close I was
Just how long I was in that place
Exactly how much sense death made to me
in the face of all I was facing
And I rember
what everyone else in my life was doing at the time
And what they weren't doing, too.

I wanted somebody to give me permission to leave
to tell me my time was up.

Lately, I've been praying
And prayer isn't what I thought it was
and I'm still not sure if it makes sense to me
But I'm going to do it
Whatever it take's to get me through
and when it's not working 
I'm going to learn something new
Whatever it take's to get me through the day
in a way that best sets me up for all the tomorrows

I've got this life
that I'm supposed to live
and I am not going to mess it up.
and I am not going to miss it.
