I am so spuratic
so clumsy
I've definatly hurt myself
more times than I can remember
far more than I can count
But those bruises
those bruises I will never forget.

I could tell you
exactly how long each one took to heal
what jokes I made
and what I wore
to cover them up

I can look
at that spot
on my skin
and remember the outline
of each color
each day
at each stage of the healing process

There is something
about a bruise
that is different
when behind it
is a person
and an intention
that
that is the part that sticks with you
forever
