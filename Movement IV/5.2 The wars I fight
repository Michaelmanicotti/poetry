The wars I fight
they are not like the ones my ancestors fought
we fight
against a power system
that considers itself superior to violence
and all those who are angry at the world it created

the battles are fought 
in the cerebral domain
but the victory we seek
it entirely corporal

we fight together
for we know this war will need foot soldiers

it has been negoiated through tension
it has been passed down through generations
and the one thing we know
is that we can't possibly we
not yet
but we can push back the front line
and we will
as far as we possibly can.
