We went to find freedom
and on the way we dropped it
we search for perfection in governance
and on the way we lost it
we inveted countless objects on our travels
to make things better
And we never stopped
we never ask
who we were and what we struggled with

You were there behind us
answering all of the questions
taking stock of where we were
you picked up what we dropped
and added them to your burden
It was out unspeakable mistake
To look on without looking back
at who we were
where exactly we're going?
we never were quite sure

We spiraled and spun out of control
and we took it out on you
and we lost track of where we were
we didn't know what to do

You picked up all the pieces
you figure it all out
you held on to our humanity
with no choice but to reach out
