The thing about poems
is that sometimes you write from exactly where you are

sometimes 
you write about where you want to be going

sometimes
you write so you can leave where you've been
and be ready for something new

it is said
that optamism can leave you disapointed

but hope
hope can leave you all together
and sometimes you don't realize she left
and sometimes we are forced to reckon 
with how we treated her when she was here.

It is not that she was a blessing
in a life of blessings
she was your life
and all the other blessings
they came from her

It is not that we forgot to cherish her
it is that we failed to respect her

For she is the force
That protects us from ourselves.

Hope is power,
even in the face of great odds.
