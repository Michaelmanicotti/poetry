Fuck Fuck Fuck
I hate making new friends
It's not that something happened
just the anxiety never ends

A single text, sent or not
is enough to set me off
I don't know why I struggle to cope
but every interaction has me trying not to choke.

It's other people that scare me.
They feel like so much work.
They have so many feelings
They all have so much worth

I don't know if I hate
The seeing or being seen
But technology makes it worse
The lines no longer clean

A myriad of rules spins around me
They are too much to understand
I don't want to be misunderstood
I look for a place to land

It gets easier over time
At some point a rhythm emerges
I just have to calm down enough
to prepare for the next round of torture

You have to fail in those early days,
you have to learn the bounds
But you feel like a bull in a china show
waiting for the building to fall down
