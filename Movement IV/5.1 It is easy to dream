It is easy to dream of being king
of owning the domain
of infinite power 
and infinite wealth

it's hard to dream of being manager
or an engineer
or a nurse in a cooperative
or a bank teller
it's hard to dream of limitations
of reality
of being a part of the same system

it's easy to dream of love
of romance
of nights out and slow dances
it's hard to dream 
of folding cloths
of disciplining children
of datenights that disolve so quickly into fights

we dream big
not out of kindness
but because we are afraid
we are afraid to reshape reality
we are afraid there will be no gaps
so we learn to live with what we are a part of

it is hardest of all to dream of evolution
of slow tumultuous progress
of generations that learn different lessons
of people that that learn different tricks

it is hard to dream of rebuilding
when you are promised nothing but the transion stage
when you vision gets put into the clothes dryer 
and tossed around with other peoples dreams

it is hard to dream of reconstruction
when we aren't even sure if another way is possible
it is easy to dream of where you're going
but that doesn't help you get there

the real dream is never what we care to admit
and further than we care to imagine

I dream of the next step
and I find myself shaking in fear
wondering if we'll get there
