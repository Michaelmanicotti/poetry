I am unsure
if I have finished my recovery.

I am waiting
for the line that indicates the end of withdrawl
and the begining of so-called regular life.
It does not seem to be labeled very well.

I find myself exhausted by people
I easily spiral when alone
And I wonder
If life was always like this
Only I didn't notice it before
