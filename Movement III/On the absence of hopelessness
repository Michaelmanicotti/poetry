  And the thing is
  the unbelievable
  infuriating
  egregous thing is
  
  Everyone else left me heart broken
  Everyone else left me hopeless
  for a moment
  
  for a moment I thought
  he's not out there
  there will never be the one
  I'm just not one of those people
  who finds that type of love
  no matter how hard I look
  
  And then I would realize
  I'm still myself
  I'm still the person I love
  nothing has changed
  except I gained information 
  and the search continues

Not you

  you left me with hope
  and that
  that hope
  it changed me
