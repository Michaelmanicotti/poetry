And the thing is
the unbelievable
infuriating
egregous thing is

Everyone else left me heart broken
Everyone else left me hopeless
for a moment

for a moment I thought
he's not out there
there will never be the one
I'm just not one of those people
who finds that type of love
no matter how hard I look

And then I would realize
I'm still myself
I'm still the person I love
nothing has changed
except I gained information 
and the search continues

Not you

you left me with hope
and that
that hope
it changed me
