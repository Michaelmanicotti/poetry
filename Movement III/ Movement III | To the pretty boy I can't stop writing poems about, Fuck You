Movement III | To the pretty boy I can't stop writing poems about, Fuck You for stealing my heart.

Interestingly, this movement was originally supposed to be titled:
Movement III | Why am I not dead yet?
(The plan was to get around to writing poems about big ideas 
as an interesting juxtaposition to "Poetry About Nothing.")

And then,
there was a pretty boy I couldn't stop writing poems about.

It was a major inconvience.

I am going to pretend, I'm not still mad about it.

In a way these poems are perhaps about the bigest idea of them all.
To all those who find  a part of themselves in this work,
I wish you the best of luck.

The astute among you might have noticed that these poems come in not a well choreographed order but organized alphabetically by title.
That's because the order I wrote them in doesn't make any sense, and feelings don't make any sense,

and also it's for him: some poems I wrote, while I was a hot mess of feelings, that are now neatly alphabetized. 

And now you understand why I am so angry.
