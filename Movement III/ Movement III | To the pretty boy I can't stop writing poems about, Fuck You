An Introduction:
Interestingly, this movement was originally supposed to be titled:
Movement III | Why am I not dead yet?
(The plan was to get around to write poems about big ideas 
as an interesting juxtaposition to "Poetry About Nothing.")

And then,
there was a pretty boy I couldn't stop writing poems about.

It was a major inconvience.

I am going to pretend, I'm not still mad about it.

In a way these poems are perhaps about the bigest idea of them all.
To all those who find  a part of themselves in this work,
I wish you the best of luck.

Some of you might have noticed that these poems come in not a well choreographed order but alphabetically by title.
That's because the order I write them doesn't make any sense, a feelings don't make any sense,

and also it's for him: some poems I wrote, while I was a hot mess of feelings, that are now alphabetized.
