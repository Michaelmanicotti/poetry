At least this one happened on the outside
the battles in my head are much more unwinable

At least it gives me something to do
something to analyze
something to be
something to try and get right
this time

At least I am here
At least these problems are my problems
At least this brain is my brain
At least I'm not taking that for granted

You see, I'm not scared of heartbreak
I'm not scared of tragedy
I'm not afraid it'll all be over
I'm afraid I'll have missed it
my life
I'm afraid I'll wake up one day and not know where I am
or how I got there
or who took me

I'm afraid I'll be so focused on it
whatever it is
that I will lose track of everything else
that I will forget who I am
and cease to exist

so yeah it still hurts
it hurts to be seen
it hurts to be me
it hurts to have shown up and have everyone ask you 
                                                    why you're here
it hurts to be made fun of
and it hurts still more not to know
whether or not they are making fun of you
I don't think they know either
I don't know if they care

But at least I showed up
at least I did my best
at least I wrote my way through it
fuck it
I'm a writer
that's just what writers have to do

I hadn't perfected my poetry yet
but I'm out here trying
and I am sometimes insecure
and I sometimes need to talk about stuff
or sometimes just get it off my chest
and sometimes I don't know what to say
or howr to say it
and so, I write

so yeah it still hurts
I am looking for love
and I will freely admit it
but I am also giving love too
carefully
quiety
I just wish you would see it
