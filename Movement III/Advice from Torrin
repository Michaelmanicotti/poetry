if he's not ready
then that's it
that's the end of discussion
because in the time that it will take him to change and grow
you will have changed and grown too.
you'll be a different person
and you don't know who you'll be then

you tend to feel the need to know things
and for that to be a part of you
you can know something
and be totally deteched from it

you just have to practice that
