It is hard to explain but

sometimes
for some of us
we grieve ahead of time

we let all the feelings out
so that way
when it actually happens
we have that much more practice
we are that much more ready

somtimes we grieve
so that way
when we actually have to do it
we have the strength
the clarity
the frame of mind 
to do the right thing

and sometimes
we chose heartbreak
on purpose
just so we have to grieve
in the hopes that we'll never have to grieve at all
it never seems to work that way

and sometimes
sometimes
we're not even sure why we're grieving
we just do it
and then it happens
