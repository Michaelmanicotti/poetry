And when it is all over
There's that little bit you're scared to talk about
The thing you don't want to confront
And you debate yourself
On wether or not it's worth confronting at all
anyway you've gotten this far

In your heart you know
and regardless, practically speaking
it won't go away and it won't leave you alone
if you don't

in these times
there is only one thing to do.

Be courageous.
And know, that courage is not mythology
it is woven into the tiny acts of our lives
while it is sometimes only known to the actor
often it is realized by the outside world

courage is an interesting object
for it sits at the intersection
of the infitisimaly smal
and the seemingly insurmountable

it is hearing that voice in your head
that you don't want to listen to
begin to knock
and greeting it it at the door.

You don't have to let her in
but you do have to greet her
and you do have to listen to her
just in case she left something behind

It never stops being hard
but with practice
we rise to meet it
and it has always been done this way, 
and always 
it will.
