And then, it all sinks in
there's no room
in people's lives for you

no room for you to be needed
or believed in

no room for you to be felt 
or seen

no room for you to help
nothing for you to do

and wherever you are
you are trapped
you are caught
not in a place
but in a space
inbetween

left out
in the intercellular matrix
and it all sets in
the hopelessness
the weight
the preasure
exerted by the everything arounf you
the empty your not a part of

and you're scared 
you hope you can carve
out a home here
but your not sure what that means
you're not sure if you'll be enough

and so
you are pushed around
tumbled about
by everything you're not a part of
everything out there

and you're not sure if here is a place you want to be
because you're not sure if here is a place one can be at all.
