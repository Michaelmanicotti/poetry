An Introduction:
Interestingly, this movement was originally supposed to be titled:
Movement III | Why am I not dead yet?
(The plan was to get around to write poems about big ideas 
as an interesting juxtaposition to "Poetry About Nothing.")

And then,
there was a pretty boy I couldn't stop writing poems about.

It was a major inconvience.

I am going to pretend, I'm not still mad about it.

In a way these poems are perhaps about the bigest idea of them all.
To all those who find in them a part of themselves,
I wish you the best of luck.

- M.D.Mann
