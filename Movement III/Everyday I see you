You break my heart everyday
everytime you suprise me with a laugh
indulge me with a game
a joke
a smile

it is a cruel experiment
I pretend that I know you
I pretend that you are who I've been waiting for
and you never prove me wrong

I wish I wasn't so addicted to these thoughts
but
sometimes you start the game too
sometimes you say something that pushes my buttons
that reminds me
I am knowable
I am loveable
I can exist
within the realm of the familiar
the joyful
even if just in your mind
just your version of me
and then here we go again
caught back in the game
catching up with the heart break

because I love that version of me
that person you want to know
I'm in love with him too
and I'm scared
I'm scared once you leave
I won't be him anymore
I won't be able to get back to him anymore

And I look forward to the heartbreak
Everyday
I hope
I pray
please just let me see his face again
please just let me know what it is like to be with him
just give me one of those moments
one of those suprises
just so I can study it
so I can know
so I can learn
who is that guy like?
the one who exists when he is around you
I need to meet him
I need to be able to access him later
and later he will disapear with the heartbreak
but I need to meet him one more time
so later I can be who I need to be.

I'm not supposed to say anything
And I know I can't tell you
and I know you tried your best 
not to break my heart
and you failed 
spectaularly
and I love you for that.
