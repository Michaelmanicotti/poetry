I do this thing

I write lists in my head
lists of books I think you might like

The lists are my way of processing
they are a substituion for the words:

"Hey

It was so unkind of you to agree to go on a first date with me. 

You shouldn't have said yes. Because ever since I've been trapped in your web. And everyday I 
get more trapped and everyday I get more heartbroken. And I am scared. Terrified. That all 
these things are going to lead me to fuck it all up more.

And I know I should talk to you about it because holding it all it only makes things worse for me.
Harder to process. More stuck.

But last time I tried, I didn't even know how to talk about it.
And I don't want to make you feel like that again."

And I am not half as couragoues as you.
And I write.
In the hopes that it might leave you enough space to be yourself.
That part of you that is free
and open
and honest (in his own way)
that part of you doesn't need to be couragous.

Because that boy
is beautiful.
And I am torn
between wanting to see as much of him as possible
and wanting desperatly to just watch as he exists
and evolves over time.

And I am not careful in my nature
but this time
I find myself looking for guidence
because I don't want to make him disapear again.

He has something to teach me.
And the price of that lesson is heart break.

And for the record, you warned me
But I underestimated you.
We both did.

And so I leave you with bell hooks,
I leave you with Peter Wohlleben and I leave you with Phillip Dettmer 
I leave you with worlds to get lost int
Because I know
As long as you are lost in those worlds
You are safe
And in my head the list just keeps getting longer
the hope is, if the list is long enough
it might buy me just enough time
to just get my goddamn act together.
