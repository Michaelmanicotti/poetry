A note: to whomever it may concern

You would not believe how many poems it takes to get me through the day these days.

It is very difficult to make a poem feel anxious.

I don't know if these poems are helping.

They at very least give me a sense of where I'm at. (Maybe that'll help me move out of my own way. who knows?)

Thank you for reading,

        Michael D. Mann
