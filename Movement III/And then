And then we move on
we laugh
we sing
we watch 
we play

at some point

we get our lives back
it's not easy to notice
but if you know what peace feels like
you'll know when it comes back to you

it's getting easier to find this place
though I still struggle sometimes
you must put work in 
to seek it out

you try new movies
you explore new movements
if you're lucky, you've made a few new friends 
the hard thing is to appreciate
you don't know when you'll be back here again
