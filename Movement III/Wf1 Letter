To whomever it may concern,

  Let me tell you,
  It's been a fucking semester.

  I did meth
  and survived the withdrawl
  and a drug induced manic episode

  and at the same time
  I got drugged 
  and sexually assaulted
  and healed from it
  and grew from it

  I fell in love
  and I got my heart broken
  and I got through that too

  and I got a job, and I got the grades 
  and I did some top shelf writing.

  I am a more complete person 
  that I was before.

  I'd love to see what life has 
  in store for me next

  Fuck.
  I hope it's less. 

  (I hope it's rest.)

Love,
  Michael

P.S. I'm back to myself again...
                 and I've still got it â™¡.
