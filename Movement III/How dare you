To the boy who stole my heart:
How dare you?

How dare you be so kind
when the world has been so unknind to you

How dare you be so patient
in a world that is so fast pace

How dare you struggle to express yourself
and take your time
and when you finally find the words
get them perfectly right

How dare you have the audacity to hack me
How dare you tell me that you weren't trying to
How dare you avoid holding my hand
avoid pulling me close
avoid playful affection
avoid quiet intimate moment
in the hopes that you wouldn't

how dare you steal it anyway
with every look
every breath
every moment
every word
and every hesitation
you found your way back to all you were avoiding
every. single. time.

and most of all
most of all
how dare you

for telling me you don't know what romance is
for telling me you don't know what it is to be a romantic
when all you have done
all you seem capable of doing
is sweeping me off my feet


what the actual fuck
