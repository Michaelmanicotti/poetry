It's a secret
niether one of us will talk about,
but it's my job to know how beautiful you are.

And that's hard
because if you are already this
then what is there for me to be

knowing something is difficult
because you can't know something unless you spend time with it
and that gives me a lot of time to mess up a good thing

remind me not to.
I'm doing my best.

Post Post Script:
Also please remind me never to fall in love again...
That shit is so much fucking work. It's just a real mess. 
It's not for me. And I refused to be fooled by the same trick twice.

Damn this shit is embarrassing.
