I don't know how you did it
That thing you just did.

I don't know how you found the words.
I don't know how you knew where to look.
I don't know how you knew me well enough
to say that
in that way
that thing
that I so desperatly needed to hear
that I so desperatly needed to know
that I was so desperatly trying to figure out

I know it was not easy
in fact, I can tell it was really hard
for you, it was among the hardest class of things to say
the hardest class of words to find
I know there was love there
and I finally know what that love means now

*you* handled it carefully
Delicatly
where I am impulsive and transpart
and take up space
you *decide* to show up
after careful consideration
decided to make room
despite knowing all the risks,
all the odds
and thank you

it took my breath away

I know you had to talk yourself into it
But I don't even know how you figured it out in the first place
how you knew so early on
with such accuracy
without having to know how to explain it
it is so unlike me.

It's not that I didn't expect it
It is simply that I didn't know
And not knowing
Not knowing is something I do not carry well
It's something that infects me
and infects us
and infects everything in my world.

And now
I find peace
It is not in the place I expected
And I haven't moved far from where I started
and suddenly- here
suddenly being here makes a lot more sense to me
suddenly I have room
suddenly I have permission
to strech out my legs
to change into something more comfortable
to take a deep breath and 
be something I know I know how to be

I don't know how you did it
and I really don't care
I am just happy 
that you took my breath away
so I can finnaly breath again
