Holding my breath

The truth is I'm holding my breath
the truth is it's too early to tell
and I really
I really don't know

I'm trying to let myself be suprised
trying to let the ball roll forward
trying to watch the paper unfold

holding my breath
hoping I don't miss it
watching to see
what happens as it all plays out

the truth is I don't want to waste it
so I have to use it all up
on calming down
on feeling feelings
so that way time might open up

the truth is I'm hoping for suprise
because my mind gets so compressed
it will race and it will threaten and
it will pathologize
but it's all just a monotonous aversion to rest

so I keep spending time making space
so I can exist out there
and I really hope I don't miss it
the chance to find wonder 
in the depths of dispair
