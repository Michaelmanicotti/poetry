And this one is a love poem
To all those who took the time
to learn the geography

some did it through careful survey
some did it through intuition
some did it by bumbling around, getting lost.. over and over again

they found themselves up against cliffs
they found themselves trapped underwater... in the darkest of caves
they found themselves camping out in a peaceful spot
until suddenly a storm blows in
and yet they stayed

they decided this was a place they wanted to be
a place worth exploring
they decided that learning the terrain here
might leave them better equipped elsewhere
or else they found it at times so curious and wonderful
they decided to stick around when things got tumuluous and harrowing

they are the most stubborn
the most courageus 
the most ingenious 
the most beautiful of creatures
and this world
could not exist without them

it is
at once
the most exciting of adventures
and then the most formidible of opponents
that place inside my head

it is everything to know
I am not going in alone.
