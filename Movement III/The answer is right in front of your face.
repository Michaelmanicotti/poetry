Love,
in this economy?
But whoever has the time?

There's too much to do
Too much to say
Too much to experience
We have to work before we can play

Love takes evolution 
Love takes change
Change is expensive

Who has the time?
When there's so much to be done
So we sit and we shake 
and we temble
and we move

We barely have time to take a nap
so who has space for heartbreak?
we don't have time to clean
we forget to eat
we lay awake at night
alone 
in our beds
hoping
praying
so who was the time?

Love takes too much room
it eats everthing up
our thinking becomes irrational
every moment we worry
that we might have fucked up

Love can really scare us
and we know we need to heal
we need to feel safe
feel present
and know we are real

So who has time for love?
When there's so much else to do
who has time to listen
and be crazy
as love requires you to do

Love takes so much risk
and we already have are own
so instead we keep looking
for something to lighten the load
