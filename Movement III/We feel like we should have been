It feels like you've lost something
When you're too much of yourself
When you decide to be present
When you decide to take a step back
when you decide

It feels like you weren't good enough
In that moment
Because we acted or because we didn't
It's those damn retrospective curcits
Doing that damn retrospective analysis
Rewriting our decisions
with the information gained from deciding
It's an illusion or a dillusion or
something invented to hide the fact that it hurts

it hurts that we were there
it hurts that we didn't know
it hurts that we were experimenting
when we feel like 
we should have been giving the world 
a well coreographed show

and we tell ourselves
tell each other
at least you did your best
but in the end we're not sure
If we can't make the right decision
Then what are all those braincells for?

We don't want to act
we don't want to live
we just want security
a place to just exist

all this regret
it boxes us out
because without security
without healing
we don't know what we can 
and cannot live without

it feels like you lose something 
to move through the world
like the possibility tree gets smaller
with every step that you take

but in the end
we've been forging 
something new
something no one else can create
