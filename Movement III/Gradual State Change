If we are here
then something has gone terribly wrong

And I am not sure when
I am not sure if it was at any point at all really
It may have been a slow series of details
It may have started as us drifting slowly off track
I'm not sure
I was so swept up in it all
So swept up being with you
That I'm not sure I kept track of things
The way I should have
But if we are here
If I am truely in this spot
Feeling these feelings
Then something went wrong
A long while ago
And if I'm being honest
I don't know
This might be the end
I don't know if I can fix it
I don't know if we can fix it
I don't know
If it can be fixed

Please.
Please.
Just give me some time
Give me some space
I've got to figure something out
There was a time that I loved you
Now, I honestly am not sure
