An at some point you just know
This is it
This is my life
It's with him

And you can't mess this one up
because you know
in your heart
you are never going to be angier than he makes you
you are never going to be sadder than when he breaks your heart
you are never going to feel the joy
that you feel with him
you are never going to feel the peace
you find
when you realize
you have your own language the two of you.
And you worry very little because deep down
in your heart
you know
nobody else will know how to speak it
like you do

and the strange thing is
when it's over
you see him in everything
and you know that you are better
because you loved him

And when he is gone
you know
or maybe you pray
or maybe you trust
that however dumb he is
he's not stupid enough to think you didn't love him
