You asked me what the difference is
Between romance and friendship
And I told you
That they are the exact same thing
And also worlds apart
And you didn't like my answer
And you really wanted to know how best to love me
And with six hours
And our combined- and rather extraordinary- intelects
I tried to explain to you
That you already knew

For everyone else it takes work
For you it takes work too
but for everyone else
they are trying to figure me out
for you
for you the work is doing the work 
I have been a lot of things before
But I have never been intuative
Not in the way I am intuative to you

And for all those brain cells
And with all the words I gave you
models I constructed
poetry I wrote
you couldn't seem to figure that out

And now that we're apart
I realize
The answer to your question

Romance
is sitting alone
in a room
asking yourself
Why didn't I hug them?
Why didn't I hold them?
Why couldn't I figure that one out
in real time
when I was with them?
why am I figuring it out just now?

What did I do?
What did I say?
What was I supposed to do?
Who was I supposed to be?

Friendship is communion
community, consistancy
it is love in the air
at a party
it is folks that are wonderful
and kind
in a way that they want to be
in a way that they can


Romance
Well, romance is
lifethreatening
and life giving
the love we must know
so we can know how to love later

and both are a roadmap
to who we are supposed to be.
