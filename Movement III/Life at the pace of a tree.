It is not that I am deeply emotional
or deeply romantic
or beligerant 
or hysterical
and you are somehow not.
You have all the same emotions as me

yours are just slower
they are slower to build up
slower to let go
slower to process

And like all emotions
you don't know until you know
and then you know

At your default state
you are a naturalist
someone who wants to obesrve the world
in the hopes that you might get a glimmer of it's beauty
and not to touch it

I am an experimentalist
I learn through doing
poking amnd proding at things
and seeing how they respond

We both probably have something to teach each other.

Right now I must practice
looking at you
the way I look at trees

I mustn't dare to ask myself
what is going on in your head
I mustn't confuse your blankness
for absence
          of time
          of thought
          of care

I must instead breath in
Allow myself to be angry
Allow myself to be empty
Allow myself to be sad
and if I'm bold enough
allow myself to be hopeful

Most of all
I must allow myself not to know
what is happening under the surface

know that whatever is happening
It exists on a different timescale
Than that which I live my entire life

I must stop imagining
I must sit and breath
and enjoy the fresh air.
