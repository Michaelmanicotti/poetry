For too long
You explained to me all the things I ought to be changing
All the things that "woudn't cut it in the real world"

For too long
I was a to-do list:
  of grades to fix
  an attitude to adjust
  political opinions to be realigned
  mental health that needed to get in order

There was a time that you loved me
When my job was to be a kid
When I didn't have to grow up
But before I even had a chance, 
it was explained to me what a grown up was
and what I was not

It was both spelled out
and internalized:
  I'd need to love girls
  I'd need to be the right type of man
  I'd need economic sucess
  I'd need to contribute to society
  But not to change it
  At least, not to change it in a way you didn't like
  
The world isn't actually that terrible
I keep holding my breath
Waiting for you to cut off support, to fail out or drop out, to face that world you kept telling me about...
I'm not very old, so maybe I don't know.

I don't hate myself anymore though.
It's made the world easier to face,
It's made the challanges less difficult,
It's made friends easier to love, and
it's pushed us further apart.

I'm a leftist, I'm gay
I'm pro-black and concerned about how to live in a counter hedgemonic way.
I am a nerd and an egghead
I'm going to spend most of my life in school
I am goin
