The problem with humans is other humans
The problem with peoplw is
they are far too evokative.
They make you feel things.
Almost all the time.

These emotions are a lot of work to deal with
They sneak into your quiet moments and fill your head with dillusion and computation
They make your chest tight and your heart hurt
They make you hold your breath
As you turn around the corner
Hoping
Just hoping 
They will be there
Hoping they just might smile when they see you
Hoping their heart races too.

It's all extreamly distracting
People have things to do
Work to accomplish
Contributions to economic growth to make
Things to learn
Bills to pay

So what the fuck is the deal with all these emotions
all these feelings brought on by other people
They take so much tim e and energy
Deciding to trust peopl
Deciding to take care of yourself
Listening to the fear of heartbreak
Trying to ignore the unresolved abandoment
It's a real problem.

Depending on others for your happiness
Letting them dictate how you feel
Being a part of this messy web of the modern world that is far too connected
and far too isolating.

The problem is that it's the entire point.
The problem is that the only way for people to be happy
                                                  at peace
                                                  fufilled
                                                  people is to have other people.
Other people who drive us crazy.
Other people who are very confusing.
Other people who are so unexpected.
Other people who are so incorragible.
We have to make them our life. We have to make ourselves be fully present in their lives.
That's what the problem is.
Fuck.
