For too long
You explained to me all the things I ought to be changing
All the things that "woudn't cut it in the real world"

For too long
I was a to-do list:
  of grades to fix
  an attitude to adjust
  a "phase" to get over
  political opinions to be realigned
  mental health that needed to get in order

There was a time that you loved me
When my job was to be a kid
When I didn't have to grow up
But before I even had a chance, 
it was explained to me what a grown up was
and what I was not

It was both spelled out
and internalized:
  I'd need to love girls
  I'd need to be the right type of man
  I'd need to be sucessful in the modern economy
  I'd need to care about economic sucess
  I'd need to contribute to society
  But not to change it
  At least, not to change it in a way you didn't like
And it was spelled out in anger
And it was spelled out in absence
  
Interestingly,
The world isn't actually that terrible
not since I've left home.
I keep holding my breath
Waiting for it all to come crashing down...
I'm not very old, so maybe I don't know, yet.

I don't hate myself anymore though.
It's made the world easier to face,
It's made the challanges less difficult,
It's made friends easier to love, and
it's pushed us further apart.

I know it's all going to get harder.
I know that the brutal part of the adventure is ahead.
I know I'm going to face them and I'm going to do my best.
(And I know sometime's that'll be enough and sometimes it won't.)

And even though I'm not done yet,
I love who I was back then.
Even though it was brutal and terrible to live through sometimes, 
it got me here.

I wish you had loved him too.
I wish you weren't so afraid he was going to be a screw up,
I wish you weren't afraid of who I was going to become because
that fear was deafening.
I hope you don't think you hid it well because it consumed me. For years.

And there were the briefest points where I sat on the edge, alone.
All of my energy spent trying to drown out that voice.
Trying to drown out all those lists we made.
The list's of all the things I wouldn't be...

Those lists...
I'm better at making them. 
I perfected the art. In the hope that if I did, 
you might finally make sense to me.

In the hope 
that if I exhausted the ways I might let you down, 
I could stop myself the next time.
(It never worked.)

I didn't know I was supposed to be figuring out who I wanted to be and what I wanted my life to look like.
Eventually I figured out that there wasn't going to be enough overlap,
there was the person who you wanted your son to be
and then there was me.
There couldn't be both.

It took a while but I found them,
All the lists that you scattered across all the parts of my life.
The ones tied to school bags
The one's left out for me
The rules about who I needed to be when I was in your presence.
I untangled them from who I was
I untangled them from how I live my life.
(Phasing it out, the reluctant compliance and the angry rejection.)

They are impossible to destroy
But now they have a home
They have a box where they can live
A box of lists
A box labeled "your son"
(It is a mirrior of the box in your head
and the entanglment,
it makes it so that one cannot be destroyed without the other.)

I mourn him for you.
I am sorry that he doesn't exist.
But the person I am,
I've done it the hard way.

I've got a new list now,
Of who I'm supposed to be
Though it is less a list than a painting.

A lot of people have helped me find it
A lot of people are helping me get there
I am sure you will again find your place amongst them.
Some day.

But untill then,
Please don't say me you're proud of me.
Please don't go out of your way to remind me of the overlap between him and me.
Please stop searching your lists and finding the boxes I've checked off.
(All the time you spend doing that, you are deciding you don't want to meet me anymore.
Any every single time it hurts.)

I really don't want to care.
I want to care about you without caring about the son you wanted to have.
I don't want to know anymore.
That box is better left closed.

I am proud of myself,
Sometimes more
Sometimes less
But more often than not
and I'm doing it the hard way
because I had to figure out who I want to be.

So please don't say you're proud of me
Because I already have enough voices in my head
worring about who it is that I might become.
