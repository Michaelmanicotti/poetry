Hell isn't that bad, I've been there.
It's actually quite comfortable.

It is full of logic
It makes you confident and self assured.
It tells you the devil isn't there
And it has proof, too. Rigerous proof

Once you step out, you can't help but to see
You'll look back and ask, why didn't I know?
You'll hate yourself and ask yourself why you chose to stay a
nd how you got there in the first place?

Hell is catered,
just for you
It tells you you're right, what ever your up to
And others are wrong for expecting anything else.

And the second you step out,
You have to look back and ask yourself
How did you do those things?
To those people?

While you are there,
People will try and help you out
You will stop them and tell them off
Explain to them their internal confusion

Because once you leave,
You will see people who are just where you were
and you won't know what to do
And, in that moment, you won't know if you've made it out yourself.

You can never say that you are in hell while you are there
and you are in fact not there at all
We all speak of hell in only the past tense
Always have vistited, never am siting

Then there are those who refure to hell in the future tense,
They are the ones who understand the terrain
What we think of as hell, is in fact the path out of it.
Because the one thing hell gives you, you must give up to leave.

it is lonely, 
it is willfully ignorant, 
it is incapable of expressing itself,
But it is comfortable. 

Sometimes it is better just to give up
You realize you are quite comfortable
You do your best to tune out the screams and the violent winds that spiral around you
And you tell yourself, you're not in hell at all.

Becasue the way out:
merciless, 
unrewarding, 
desperatly lonely, soul crushing

It is a maze you instructions, once known
have long been forgotten
It is impossible without help
And feels impossible with it.

And once you finally escape,
no one will notice.

You are back in the world of the living,
it is uncomfortable and random
it takes so much work and effort
and unlike hell, on the mortal plane, there is so much you can do wrong.

And so instead, we ask ourselves:
Is there a fate, worse than death?
