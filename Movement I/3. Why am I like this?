It's an addicting game to play,
finding the line.

No matter how much someone love's you
No matter how terrible you're feeling
No matter how much you need help
You can always exhibit a set of behaviors 
to make them chose not to take care of you.

"I'm fine" is elementary shit
Everyone is different, you can't use something so obvious
"I'm tired"'s a little better
C- work, but passing.

But me, I'm a straight a students
I'm talking about pretending to do work, so it's hard to tell if I'm moping
I'm talking about having an episode silently
in the living room, laying on the floor, arguably obvious enough
(But I've picked a time I know they won't come in.)

I have taught the people around me to know I'm strange
I know I'm strange enough that most things won't raise a flag
A deep sign in the middle of a crowded room,
A yelp from excitedly solving a problem I've been working on in my head
A general appearence of frazlement and distrought
These are the good days, rambunctious and hard to interperet.
It makes it easy for those who get to know me to invest stock in the statement,
"Oh Michael, he's just like that."

This give's me room.
Room to hide the recipts in plain sight.
They are perfectly tailored for each person who loves me.
I get bonus points because I can argue to them, only in retrospect, 
that it was obvious.
Obvious I needed help.
To someone else, anyone else might have known.
I know you. I love you.
So I know the place's you forget to check.
I know the easy puzzles you will chose not to solve.
I know the games you will chose not to play.
Every time.

I get points because it's remarkably consistent,
I can create a pattern.
For my brother, it's always in the assumption
that in being quiet means I want to be alone
He's like that, he prefer's others respect his solitude
so he will always have an intuition twoards .
For my dad it is in the silence of my anger, 
He has and always will believe
I have no right to be angry without an explination.
For my best friend it always in intellectual puzzles, in complicated communication
The very banter that provides us so much joy provides an easy means of distraction
(When your best friend has a hard time expressing his emotions directly, it's easy to sneak past him the fact that you're expressing yours.)
For my sisters it in tension, I know they won't confront.
That one is perhaphs the easiest, it is a dance we have choreographed since birth. 
(My parents wanted to raise respectable children, and they suceeded.)

I don't know when the game started.
It may be a vestibular skill
One that started as a meaningful way to cope
I had to avoid to avoid processing my emotions myself
which means I needed to avoid others involvement.

When you get good at winning a game it's
hard to stop playing.
When getting good tears your life apart 
and rips at the seams of what you care most about
it's an addiction.
I don't know how to stop.
I am good at hacking people, that's just a part of who I am.
But I have to stop.
I have to.

I have a lot of people in my life who love me.
Now that I'm one of them, I have to work on it too.
I have to detangle it and reign it in.
The better I get at diagnosing the problem though,
The more I have to ask,
"Why am I like this?"
The more baffled I become at how much people love me,
the more I try and do better,
the more I have to give myself room,
the more I have to forgive myself.

The strange thing is that I think, through all this,
I just might be worth it.
