Dear God, I have some notes.

Firstly, what's the deal with society?
Evolving humans to fit within small nomadic tribes that live in harmony with nature
then deciding to make large scale civilation part of the plan...
It doesn't make much sense.
It seems as though we are not very well adapted for our enviroment.

Secondly, making humans care a lot about different things but not giving us the mathematical capability to optamise multiple variables
does not seem like a good plan.
It would make more sense to make each human care about one useful thing.
Instead life is just full of constant mistakes.
Constant suboptimal decisions that reveal themselve's only in retrospect.
Constant failure to live up to our values.
It's because we have too many.

Finally, I'd like to know why you chose to make me a writer.
I hate writing. It's terrible. 

If you'd like to fill me in on some of the details of that ineffible plan of your's
it be greatly appreciated.

In love and in spirit, 
      Michael
