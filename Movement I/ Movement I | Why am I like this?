Movement I | An Introduction

"I need to feel strongly,
 to love and to admire,
 just as desperately as I need to breathe."
 
  	Jean Dominique-Bauby
  	The Diving Bell and The Butterfly
  	1997
 
That quote is from a chapter entitled "The Vegetable",
It is the chapter in which Bauby describes his reason for writing in the first place. 
It is neither love nor admiration that Bauby cites as his motivation for deciding to write 
The Diving Bell and The Butterfly, though these are the dominant feelings expressed in the book.
Bauby writes out of anger.
 
He is angry at some former colleagues of his in Paris who had the audacity to call him "a vegetable" 
simply because he was completely paralyzed except for the muscles in one eyelid.
 
Bauby himself makes me angry, 
he was able to write a whole book with one eyelid 
faster than I'm able to write a book with all four of my limbs intact.
 
It is a delightful memoir and a testament to the indomitable human spirit. 
May he rest in peace.
