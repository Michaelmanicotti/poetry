"I need to feel strongly,
 to love and to admire,
 just as desperatly as I need to breathe."
 
      Jean Daumonique-Buaby
      The Diving Bell and The Butterfly
  
 That quote is from a chapter called "The Vegtable", 
 in which Bauby describes his reason for writing in the first place.
 It is nither love nor admiration that Bauby cites as his reason for deciding to write,
 though those emotion are what we often associate with our shared humanity,
 but anger. 
 
 He is angry at some former coulleges of his in Paris 
 who had the audacity to call him "a vegtable" simply because
 he was completely paralized except for the muscles in one eyelid.
 
 Bauby himself make me angry, 
 he was able to write a whole book with one eyelid
 faster than I'm able to write a book with all four of my limbs in tact.
 It is a delightful memior and a testament to the indominable human spirit.
