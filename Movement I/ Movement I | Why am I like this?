"I need to feel strongly,
 to love and to admire,
 just as desperatly as I need to breathe."
 
      Jean Daumonique-Buaby
      The Diving Bell and The Butterfly
      1997
  
 That quote is from a chapter called "The Vegtable", 
 it is the chapter in which Bauby describes his reason for writing in the first place.
 It is nither love nor admiration that Bauby cites as his motivation for deciding to write The Diving Bell and The Butterfly,
 though these are the dominant feelings expressed in the book,
 but anger. 
 
 He is angry at some former coulleges of his in Paris 
 who had the audacity to call him "a vegtable" simply because
 he was completely paralized except for the muscles in one eyelid.
 
 Bauby himself makes me angry, 
 he was able to write a whole book with one eyelid
 faster than I'm able to write a book with all four of my limbs in tact.
 It is a delightful memior and a testament to the indominable human spirit.
 May he rest in peace.
