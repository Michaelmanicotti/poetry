It is suprising, how long it takes to seep in
The fact that you matter
"Self worth"

It is a fluid with the viscocity of asphalt
you can look at it for hours
for days
waiting for it to drip
until you decide it's not a fluid at all

It's like the hour hand on the clock
You can stare at it
watch it
see how it doesn't more
you can prove to someone that it doesn't more
at any given time 

Then you go
live your life
and you come back
and it's in a totaly different spot
and you look in the mirror 
and you ask yourself
when did I get so strong
when did I think that I mattered
when did I learn respectful confrontation
when did I get so patient
when did I get so loving
when did I gain such a capacity for vulnerability

when did I become that person
who is staring back at me
