I've decided all poetry is bad poetry.

It was more a decision of convience actually.
I mesn disrespect to all the writers who have 
discovered that they write quite excellent poetry,
and who have taken to being poets.

The truth is, I'm not sure if I am even writing poetry.
(look I just wrote a full senatance with a period at the end.)
I have decided there is no way of knowing
wether something is poetry or not.
I like it better that way,
I have found it quite freeing.
So if you disagree with me, you can fuck off;
you're the one being the asshole.

Seconly I have decided that there is no way of knowing
wether any poetry is any good or bad.
Anyone can decided wether a poem is good or bad.
So I've decided that all poetry is bad
I've found that this decision has made poetry much easier to write.
If you have a problem with that,
please refer to the argument outlined in lines 12-15 of this poem.
