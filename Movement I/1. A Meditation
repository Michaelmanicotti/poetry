When it is summer
and so unbearably hot, that someone,
with my temprement,
who absolutely hates excessive heat
and the beating sun...

I do not wonder if it will ever cool down again,
I do not say, "this place has never been a cold place"
"there have never been cool days and they will never come again"
I don't know exactly when it will cool down but
I know it has
and I know it will

Yet, I find myself unsure if I have ever had peace in my life.
I find myself racked with anxiety as of late,
I find myself full of insecurity,
I know that I have had times when I was more peaceful than this.
I know I have had months and seasons
Where I have found my confidence and felt secure
I know that was hard earned and initially tied to the seasons of turmoil and seasons of struggle.

Yet I find myself, forgetting
that there are times where I have peace
I find myself questioning if those times were real?
Maybe I wore a coat because I was pretending it wasn't hot?
Maybe the heat was blistering and I  chose to ignore it.
Maybe this is just who I am.

I am in a season of meleancholy
and insecurity.
The first step is to find security
find confidence in who I am.
The best way to do this is through
the novel, the new, the different
the personal
the unstealable, the untakable, the ungivable.

I don't know if I can handle day to day life
but I can handle adventure.
I can handle all sorts of people.
I can handle challanges.
I wonder, If I stay living in life's rutines 
I will not be able to find security in myself

Secondly, I must be able to embrace melacholy 
This requires isolation
Not in the physical sense,
but isolation from the people around me who I care most about
To share the same space as them is to organise myself around them.
The male observer may cite this as my personal character flaw
As though I chose to prioritize others
I find it imposible to chose otherwise

Right now I must discover something
So I must cut them out temporarily 
I want to resent them less.
I want to love them more.
I think I need to miss them,
I think I need to miss my life.
And then it will cool down again.
