For a long time, 
I have know I was smart, 
but that my wandering and abundant intelligence did not well reflect in grades and school perfomance.

At first it was something I didn't mind,
As a teenager I saw more joy in the comedy
of the the fact that tachers were shocked that I had poor grades,
than I was a disapointment to myself.

As I grew older and began to except the central role that education and academica would play in my life,
it became harder.

I had love for learning, a passion to achieve interesting feats but lacked merit.
The oppertunity to invest in new research seemed to require having already acomplished,
having something I lacked.

This is common in the United States,
the desire for oppertunity so on ca beget more oppertunity.
Oppertunity is, acording to our mythos, embeded in and inseperable from the structure of our society as Americans
so we all just sit around and wonder where it is.

I have grown accostomed to this academic discontentment.
This gap in my ability and the result of the systems designed to measure it.
It doesn't bother me so much anymore.

Strangley however, the feeling has shifted into my love life.
There are those who understand me and
there are those who want to date me.

No one has done both.

It didn't matter before.
Now it matters.
At night in bed there is notable no one.

Why is everyone measuing the wrong things in a partner?
(If I am to believe I am such a great catch.)

Love is god's meritocracy.

As a society we are all getting worse at it.
How did we do that?

Fuck it.
