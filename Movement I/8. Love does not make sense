Love does not make sense.

Love has no sense of reciprocity.
You can become the best at loving
You can handle every interaction with perfection
You can optamize your life to put as much love as possible into the world
You would be living the only life worth living
You would be investing in the only reliable source of satisfaction
And yet
You cannot garuntee you will feel loved.
You cannot force the presence of love into your life
You can weight the dice but you always have to roll
There are always other things to do
There are always situations to be dealt with
There is always change that we have to face.
So the people who you have spent all your love on
may not love you back
They may not love you any more
They may stop remembering how
They may not have learned in the first place
They might swich between love and abuse,
and not know they're doing it.
They may decided to focus on themselves
Or someone else.
You don't get to decide.
Most of the power over the love you feelin in your life
will always be held by others.
You will never have enough by yourself.
Most of the power you have is over how much you love others
So even if you play the perfect game,
Even if you get delt all the right cards...
you can still find yourself siting
alone
wondering where all the love in your life went.
Wondering wether you did the right things.
Wondering wether you even know how to play at all.

Love is the economists worst nightmare.
The value of any single decision,
any single transaction,
changes every second,
in fractions of a second.
The value of any one decision as translated into love relies on an obscene number of variables:
  the person recieving the love
  the way the person recieving the love understands the transaction
  the emotional state of both parties
  the local envrioment
  the state of the world
All of which are very hard to measure
All of which change every beat of every moment
And all of which change what it means to love.
With know garuntee that even if you accomplish what you set out too you'll get a return on investment.

Love is chaos.
It represents all that we cannot model:
  non-linearity
  sensativity to initial conditions
  rapid variation from extreamly predictable to widly unpredictable
  and that variation varies in a way that is un predictable
It is at best probabalistic
At worst a solution whose mere approximation is unapproachable
Yet we are all constantly trying to perfect our models.
By constructing a local enviroment where we can pretend it makes sense.

Love has only two consistancies:
1.Love always matters.
  It always matters more to us than anything else.
  Even when we absorb it,
  we take it for granted.
  Even when we make no attempt to love anyone back,
  it matters.
  No matter how much we see it,
  it matters.
  It is simultaniusly the foundation and the pyramidion of our lives.

2.Love always ends.
  And it always ends badly.
  It ends in heartbreak,
  It ends in grief,
  It ends in death.
  Death is the easiest way out.
  And the one that hurts everyone the most.
  And that pain is garunteed only to those who loved us.
  
So the question is not why is there not enough love?
It is definitionally irrational and unsolvable at the best of times.
These are not the best of times.
The question is, why is there so much love in the first place?
Why is there so much love that each of us has seen it,
some in everything
some in the most fleeting barest of moments.
But there's at least enough that we all know what it is.
We all know it's worth staying for,
we all want to try, we all hate when we fail.
Why?
People are making love appear all the time all around us?
How are any of us ever get good at loving?
Where did we learn to do that?
That's the part that doesn't make sense, the abundance of what should be scarce.

The lack of originality
How did anyone first know to try?
Some things must simply be attributed to god and evolution.
Niether one makes much sense.
