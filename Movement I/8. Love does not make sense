Love does not make sense.

Love has no reciprocity.
You constantly invest time and care.
You exhaust mental energy.
You make mistakes
and agonize over them
and strive
with every fiber of your being to do better.
You study your interactions with others.
Try and mimic the love they give.
You try and obtain the security they appear to find.
with love
And yet
There's no way of knowing
how much love is in your life or when it will come.
Sometimes
It is like a slot machine whose dials turn seemingly at random
as you watch
hoping to get the right numbers, (in the tumble of everyone else's lives)
and know there's nothing you can do.
No matter how you pull the handle,
You don't really have a say on where the dials land.

You can become the best at loving
You can handle every interaction with perfection
You can optamize your life to put as much love as possible into the world
You would be living the only life worth living
You would be investing in the only reliable source of satisfaction
And yet
You cannot garuntee you will feel loved.
You cannot force the presence of love into your life
You can weight the dice but you always have to roll
There are always other things to do
There are always situations to be dealt with
There is always change that we have to face.
So the people who you have spent all your love on
may not love you back
They may not love you any more
They may stop remembering how
They may not have learned in the first place
They might swich between love and abuse,
and not know they're doing it.
They may decided to focus on themselves
Or someone else.
You don't get to decide.
Most of the power over the love you feelin in your life
will always be held by others.
You will never have enough by yourself.
Most of the power you have is over how much you love others
So even if you play the perfect game,
Even if you get delt all the right cards...
you can still find yourself siting
alone
wondering where all the love in your life went.
Wondering wether you did the right things.
Wondering wether you even know how to play at all.
